# PySpark-SparkSQL-Analysis

Greetings,

Welcome to the PySpark-SparkSQL-Analysis repository! Within this project, a large housing dataset was analyzed via the ApacheSpark framework (PySpark & SparkSQL) in order to determine the following key metrics:

- What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year?

- What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms?

- What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet?

- What is the average price of a home per "view" rating having an average home price greater than or equal to $350,000? 

**Repository Stucture:**

- 'parq_home_sales' directory: Contains Parquet partitioned data by the 'date_built' field

- "Home_Sales.ipynb" - Executed Python/Spark analysis code

Thanks!
